# With RSpec, we are always describing the behavior of classes,
# modules and their methods. The describe block is always used at the top to
# put specs in a context. It can accept either a class name, in which case the
# class needs to exist, or any string you'd like.

describe DockingStation do # syntax for testing class instance - accepts class name
  it { is_expected.to respond_to :release_bike}
  it 'releases working bikes' do
    bike = subject.release_bike
    expect(bike).to be_working 
    # to check working returns false, use not_to eg. 
    # expect(bike).not_to be_working 
  end
  it { is_expected.to respond_to(:dock).with(1).argument}
end



# be_XXX where XXX is name of method, responds to method call. eg. be_crying responds to crying? (true or false)
#Â the test will pass if the method returns true

# subject in line 11 is basically self. So we call method release_bike on class DockingStation.
# this method - when called - returns new instance of class Bike.
# we call it bike :P
